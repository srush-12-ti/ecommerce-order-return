#  E-commerce Returned Products — Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that explores **returned product patterns** in an e-commerce dataset.

---

##  **Project Overview**

**Objective:**  
To uncover insights about why products are returned, how return patterns vary by product category, price, discounts, ratings, or other attributes — and to help the e-commerce platform reduce return rates through actionable strategies.

Key questions addressed:
- Which product categories have the highest return rates?
- Are low-rated products more likely to be returned?
- How do price and discounts relate to returns?
- Are certain brands or categories more prone to returns?
- What patterns can help the business minimize costly returns?
